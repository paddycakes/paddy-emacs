* Macintosh Specific Setup

** # is broken on UK Macs

   On UK keyboards shift-3 is bound to Â£. This is a real pain. The #
   character is usually bound to M-3. This also causes problems,
   especially with things like window-number modes. The # problem is
   solved with this bit of code below.
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c 3") (lambda () (interactive) (insert "#")))
   #+END_SRC
